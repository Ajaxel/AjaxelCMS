This directory contains the GeoIP Free Netblock Edition.  The file is
a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file and contains three columns:

1. beginIpNum
2. endIpNum
3. netblockOwner

To calucate beginIpNum and endIpNum, use the following formula:

ipnum = 16777216*w + 65536*x + 256*y + z

where

IP Address = w.x.y.z

Note that the file is a large download, so you may want to look at the
sample contained in the SAMPLE.txt file in this directory.
