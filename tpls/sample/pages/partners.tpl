	<h2>{'About Partnering'|l}</h2>
	<p><em>{'[about-partnering-intro]Partnering is an excellent way to round out skill sets on a per-project basis, and “virtual agencies” are becoming increasingly common. Maybe you want to stay lean and not staff up in every area. Maybe you are transitioning into new territory and need a skilled collaborator. While able to offer a complete package, 
	Ajaxel Studio is also experienced in being a team player.'|l}</em></p>

	<p>{'@[partner-text]Whether partnering with design groups, agencies, IT firms, or internal client teams, flexibility, tight process, and solid team communication are key. Hexatrope brings a great wealth of experience in this area, drawn from years of creative collaboration.<br>
<br>
Common scenarios involve things like turn-key web design & build packages, as well as Drupaling your site designs (and consulting on to maximize the opportunities & capabilities this CMS brings). This isn’t a commodity approach where you chuck the design over the wall and hope it comes out, but we work with you in a truly collaborative process of expanding possibilities, shaping experience, and training your end users. Take a look at our breakout on Ajaxel site creation. Any way you slice it, collaboration can provide substantial benefit for all parties when everyone knows how to work together.<br>
<br>
Are you just getting into content managed sites? No problem, we are here to help. Are you looking to go beyond just blogs, and use a well-rounded general CMS (that also does blogs)? Get in touch with us.'|l}
