This package contains Ajaxel Content Management System with 8 different websites (templates) and Denwer Apache Web Server for Windows XP/Vista/7/8. This means you will get a real web server on your computer and the website you going to work with, will be installed on your local machine. 

You may later upload from C:\WebServer\home\cms\www\ to FTP server when you want to have your website with Ajaxel CMS to be online. Please note, these templates we included to installation is our work we've done for our clients and they shall not be used for commercial websites, these templates are examples so you understand how Ajaxel CMS works and how to create new websites. You may use same programs these websites use, but you need to change design (graphics, logos, names and etc..)
